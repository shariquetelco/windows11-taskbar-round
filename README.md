## 🚀 Installation

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/shariquetelco/windows11-taskbar-round/releases)
2. Download the latest `.exe` or `.zip`
3. Run the app (no installation required)
4. Configure margins, radius, and alignment from the tray

## To use
### Basic options
The simplest way to use RoundedTB is by simply entering a margin and corner radius.
 - **Margin** - controls how many pixels to remove from each side of the taskbar, creating a margin around it that you can see and click through.
 -  **Corner Radius** - adjusts how round the corners of the taskbar should be.

### Advanced options
The advanced options allow for further customisation, at the cost of some user-friendliness.
- **Independent Margins** - in the advanced settings, a <kbd>...</kbd> button appears on the margin box. Click it to enable independent margins, which allow you to specify the margin for each side of the taskbar. You can also use negative values to hide the rounded corners for some sides, allowing you to "attach" the taskbar to different sides of the monitor.
- **Dynamic Mode (Windows 11)** - dynamic mode automatically resizes the taskbars to accommodate the number of icons in it, making the taskbar behave similarly to macOS' Dock.
- **Split Mode (Windows 10)** - split mode is a simplified version of dynamic mode for Windows 10. Due to a more limited taskbar, dynamically resizing the taskbar isn't possible. However after some setup, split mode allows you to separate the taskbar from the system tray and resize it at will. I admit it's certainly not as cool as dynamic mode but for now it's better than nothing 🥺. For info on setting up, see the bottom of this readme.
- **Show System Tray** - this toggles whether or not the system tray, clock etc. is displayed in dynamic/split mode. It can be toggled at any time by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>.

#### Limitations
- Split mode doesn't resize itself automatically. This feature will be coming to RoundedTB for Windows 10 in the future.
- Toolbars are not compatible with split mode currently, and will need to be disabled apart from one. This is because toolbars are used to mark the "empty" space on the taskbar.
- Split mode only works when the taskbar is horizontal at the top or bottom of the screen, and on the primary monitor.

#### Setup
1. Right-click the taskbar and disable "Lock the taskbar".
2. Right-click it again and turn off any existing toolbars.
3. Right-click a third time, select Toolbars > Desktop.
4. Use the small <kbd>||</kbd> handle to resize the taskbar as you please.
